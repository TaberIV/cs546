		"biography": "I was born June 4th, 1997 and have lived in Norwalk, Connecticut my whole life, until coming to Stevens I suppose. I live in a small \"village\", as believe it is officially called, inside of Norwalk, called Rowayton. Rowayton is a great community and has been compared to as the picturesque small town you see in movies so often. I think it is an apt comparison, except for the part that the protagonist almost always wants to leave that small town for the big city, or some grand adventure. Rowayton is about an hour from New York City by train or car, and many residents commute there for work every day. This became less of a bio and more of a description of Rowayton, but I have no idea if you'll actually read this anyway.\nMy name Taber is actually my middle name, and I am in fact Edward Taber McFarlin IV, They call me Taber because my mom always really liked my dad's middle name Taber, so that's what they called me. No one has with any seriousness has ever called me Edward with the knowledge that I go by Taber. Taber is ussually a last name, Edward Taber McFarlin the first's mother's maiden name was Taber. Her father was the captain of a whailing ship.",
